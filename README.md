# Ok-Garmin
this is based off of the ok garmin meme, and it enables you to clip your gameplay saying "ok garmin" and then "video speichern"

this program itself does not clip your gameplay, you do need an external software for clipping that can be used via hotkey.
in my case, i am using NVIDIA overlay so alt+f10 works, but you may need to change it based on your clipping software
