# Ok-Garmin
this is based off of the ok garmin meme, and it enables you to clip your gameplay saying "ok garmin" and then "video speichern"

this program itself does not clip your gameplay, you do need an external software for clipping that can be used via hotkey.
in my case, i am using NVIDIA overlay so alt+f10 works, but you may need to change it based on your clipping software
(it is marked in the code where you can change the hotkeys)

the libraries you need are SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, fuzzywuzzy, pygame, os, PyAudio and keyboard
to install these you can just run "pip install" and then just put the name of the library
and to update it you can just run "pip install --upgrade" adn then put the name of the library

also make sure that you are running the latest version of python
